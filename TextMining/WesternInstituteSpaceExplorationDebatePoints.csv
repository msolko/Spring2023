For,"Mankind must always struggle to expand its horizons. The desire to know what lies beyond current knowledge, the curiosity that constantly pushes at the boundaries of our understanding, is one of our noblest characteristics. The exploration of the universe is a high ideal - space truly is the final frontier. The instinct to explore is fundamentally human; already some of our most amazing achievements have taken place in space. No-one can deny the sense of wonder, world-wide, when for the first time a new man-made star rose in the sky, or when Neil Armstrong first stepped onto the moon. Space exploration speaks to that part of us which rises above the everyday."
For,"The exploitation of space has directly changed our world. Satellites orbiting the Earth allow us to communicate instantaneously with people on different continents, and to broadcast to people all over the world. The Global Positioning System allows us to pinpoint our location anywhere in the world. Weather satellites save lives by giving advance warning of adverse conditions, and together with other scientific instruments in orbit they have helped us understand our own world better. Research into climate change, for example, would be almost impossible without the data provided by satellites."
For,"Space exploration has also led to many indirect benefits. The challenge and difficulty of the space programme, and its ability to draw on some of the finest minds, has brought about great leaps in technology. The need to reduce weight on rockets led to miniaturisation, and so to the micro-chip and the modern computer. The need to produce safe but efficient powersources for the Apollo missions led to the development of practical fuel-cells, which are now being explored as a possible future power-source for cleaner cars. The effects of zero-gravity on astronauts has substantially added to our knowledge of the workings of the human body, and the ageing process. We can never know exactly which benefits will emerge from the space programme in future, but we do know that we will constantly meet new obstacles in pursuit of our goals, and in overcoming them will find new solutions to old problems."
For,"Space exploration is an investment in the future. Our world is rapidly running out of resources. Overpopulation could become a serious worldwide threat. In this position, it would be foolish to ignore the vast potential of our own solar system – mining resources on asteroids or other planets, or even the possibility of colonising other worlds. If we fail to continue to develop the ability to take advantage of these possibilities, we may in the future find it is too late."
For,"Space exploration is inspiring and pushes humans to advance ""Space exploration is not a waste of money"". Science Ray. Sep. 30th, 2007 ---""The curiosity of humans leads us to do many things. It is probably the reason for outer space research. The evidence that has been gathered supporting interesting information has just fuelled this curiosity. Curiosity is the root to all sciences. Archaeology, biology, chemistry, physics and many other braches of science were only done because of curiosity. Without curiosity, the human race might still be in the Stone Age. Isaac Newton was curious about the falling apple and why it fell. Big curiosity has made us do big things. Space exploration might lead to a good thing too!"""
For,Space exploration inspires children to study science (an investment)
For,"Manned space--flight has spawned many scientific innovations. The need to make equipment ‘fail---safe’ because of its role in keeping humans alive in space means that the level of funding and testing is necessarily higher than for non---manned missions. This has resulted in advances that have included the Teflon found on non---stick frying pans, new ways of testing aerodynamics which have improved planes, huge improvements in computing power and software, etc."
For,Space exploration pays for itself by inspiring funders.
For,"Public funding is necessary to achieve real results in space. While the private market may be able to cater for the rich few who want to see sub---orbital space (and some 11,000 have signed up to fly there with Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactica from 2007), ultimately the boundaries of science involve keeping humans in space for long periods (the current record is 439 days), travelling further, discovering what the rest of our solar system holds and, eventually, trying to live on the moon or Mars. It is only through state subsidies that such exploration is financially possible."
For,"Space programs have relatively small budgets ""Space exploration is not a waste of money"". Science Ray. Sep. 30th, 2007 ---""Space exploration is not a waste of money. In fact, USA spends only 1% of the budget on space exploration. If it was not spent, instead of a poor person getting a dollar, he would get a dollar and 3 cents. Does this make that much of a difference?"""
For,"Space exploration is more valuable than some other human expenditures Virgiliu Pop. ""Is Space Exploration Worth the Cost?"". Space Daily. January 19th, 2005 ---""many of the critics of the space programme on social grounds are ""limousine liberals"". They point the finger at the US
government for wasting their tax
money in space instead of
helping the poor, but they are not
feeling guilty for their own
consumerist life style and for
their own scale ofpriorities.
For instance, this year, total pet---
related sales in the United States
are projected to be $31 billion –
the double, almost to the cent, of
the $15.47 billion NASA budget.
An estimated $5 billion worth of
holiday season gifts were offered
– not to the poor – but to the
roving family pets – six times
more than NASA spent on its own
roving Martian explorers, Spirit
and Opportunity, who cost the
American taxpayer $820 million
both. Instead of providing a
launch pad for the immorally
expensive shuttles, Florida can do
better and clothe the
underprivileged --- a genuine
alligator pet collar cost only $400
a piece."""
For,Space exploration has brought many practical benefits to humans
For,Humans could benefit from natural resources of other planets
For,Space exploration stimulates economic activity and jobs on Earth.
For,"Humans should not rely solely on Earth for their long--term future The potential damage done by an asteroid or  comet that collides with the Earth could
range from the impact of the
atomic bombing of Hiroshima to
the complete destruction of all
life on the planet. A manned
mission might be necessary to
destroy or divert such an object
before it reaches our planet.
There is also the potential for
other terrible damage to be done
to the Earth (whether through
climate change, warfare or
overcrowding), which could
mean that as a race we would
have no choice but to leave the
planet. In that situation, high
levels of knowledge about human
space travel and the ability to
colonise Mars or other planets
would be essential."
For,"Even if 60% of Americans
currently oppose funding a
research on Mars, if a time for
evacuation ever comes no one
will be able to oppose the
decision to evacuate Earth, thus
research on Mars should be made
mandatory"
For,"In case of the Earth being over populated or over polluted, Mars can be used to restart civilization anew. Technology can always help make humans adaptable to Earths climate."
For,"Humans are able to make judgments in space exploration
and testing. There is a
distinction between collection of
data and interpretation of data.
Robots are very good at
collecting data but not good at
responding to that data and
acting flexibly on it."
For,"Robots are inefficient at
collecting data. The most
flexible robots yet to leave Earth,
the Mars Rovers, could only
travel a few metres and test some
nearby rocks. Humans on the
Moon were able to travel
significant distances, selectively
choose rock types from a variety
of locations and prioritise
experiments based on the results
they received as they were on the
Moon’s surface. Ideally scientists
would like to understand other
planets and bodies as well as they
do on Earth. This would require
huge numbers of experiments
and surveys which would be
much better done by long
manned missions or permanent
scientific missions (as have been
posted to Antarctica for decades)
rather than a series of unmanned
missions over a decade. This also
applies to experiments carried
out in zero gravity onboard the
ISS or Space Shuttle, such as
attempts to grow protein crystals
or look at the impact of zero---
gravity on the behaviour of
organisms."
For,"Humans must be in space in
order to test the impact space
has on them. Only by having
humans in space that we are able
to find out what the impact of
space does to their physiological and psychological well being.
This makes future manned
exploration more possible as well
as teaching us about humans.
Discoveries on bone and muscle
depletion during space travel
have helped in the care of
bedridden patients and on how
to speed up the rate of muscle
growth."
For,"Manned missions force space-- craft to have greater weight-- bearing capacities for rocks. A second reason why manned experiments and exploration would be more effective is that any manned mission will necessarily be heavier. This is because it has to carry the weight of humans and their life support equipment. For this reason the cost of returning samples or carrying extra scientific equipment will be more possible because of the negligible weight they add to the payload. This means that even if the mission is primarily about political grandstanding, science will still benefit. Compare the USSR’s ability to bring back 321g of lunar rock using robots with the 382kg brought back by the US Apollo missions. The latter proved the ‘giant impact’ theory, told us a lot about the evolution and geological change of the Moon and our own Earth, and are still being studied today."
For,"Multinational space programs are good for international diplomacy. Since the “historic handshake in space” when a US Apollo and Soviet Soyuz capsules docked in 1975, the two countries have grown increasingly close. This relationship involves sharing technology (which is almost all ‘dual use’ i.e. it could be used for military purposes as well as civilian, thus requiring a high degree of trust), scientific knowledge and working side---by--- side to build and support the ISS. With the involvement of the 11 member states of the European Space Agency as well as Canada, Japan and Brazil in the project, space is one of the few spheres where governments have been able to put aside their differences in pursuit of something more fundamentally important to humanity – surely something that we should continue."
For,"Individuals are not always good at judging what is beneficial in the long term. If people are told they do not have to pay, they will probably choose not to pay. This is despite the fact that space travel has many benefits which should be supported with public money."
Against,"People can be trusted to make the right choices. When people are given the choice of whether they want contribute towards space travel, they are likely to choose the one that is best for themselves and society, whether space exploration or no space exploration is a better choice."
Against,"People should not be forced to
contribute towards something
they oppose. Even when people
do not want to fund space travel,
they are currently forced to do so.
This is unfair as people should
have a choice on issues like this,
as not paying will not harm anyone"
Against,"Flag--staking is occurring in space and spread nationalistic sentiments. Sending humans into space or to other planets so that they can erect the flag of a particular nation is a distinctly nationalistic act and one that is likely to create aggressive 'races' in the future just as it has before. China’s manned programme is openly intended to challenge the US dominance of space for the Communist regime’s huge propaganda benefit. George W. Bush’s pledge to boost spending on NASA and to restart the manned mission to Mars programme was a direct response. This is damaging not only because of the potential for space race conflicts to escalate into greater international hostility, but also because of the way such races could result in the militarization of space (as several Chinese hawks have called on the leadership to do), thereby turning something which should be preserved for the common good of humankind into a neo---colonial battlefield."
Against,"Funding should only go to cost--
effective robotic space
exploration ""Mars Rising?"". The
Economist. January 22, 2009.:
""Luckily, technology means that man can explore both the moon
and Mars more fully without
going there himself. Robots are
better and cheaper than they
have ever been. They can work
tirelessly for years, beaming back
data and images, and returning
samples to Earth. They can also
be made sterile, which germ---
infested humans, who risk
spreading disease around the
solar system, cannot."""
Against,"Some spinoff technology will come from unmanned space
travel as easily as from manned
space travel (e.g. rocket
technology, robotics, computing
power etc.), and one should bear
in mind that most manned space
programmes are centred on
under---funded programmes using
old technology due to budgetary
constraints (Russia), low
technological development
(China) or focused on repetitive
operations (USA) which do not
involve significant funding into
new technologies. As a result of
space programmes often being
closely linked to the military (in
China it is a division of the
military), the spin---offs that are
sought are usually for military
rather than consumer products,
and more likely to be kept secret
for exactly that reason. However,
the problem with the spin---off
argument in principle is that
investing in developing a non---
stick frying pan would surely be
cheaper than investing in a
manned space programme which
produces Teflon as a side---effect.
Where there are truly significant
problems and areas in need of
technological advances either the
state should fund research (as it
does in many ways through
research grants, support for
universities etc.) or the free
market will step in and exploit a
market for a new technological
solution to a problem."
Against,"Mars mission is not first in the list of priorities. There are already enough problems at home into which the money could be invested. As Patti Davis argued in 2004, the funding for the mission ---$750 billion--- would much better be used in alternative energy research and fighting climate change. [3]"
Against,"60% of Americans oppose funding a mission to Mars. ""Do you think the US should fund a Mars mission?"" 60% said no.[2]"
Against,"Humans should not bank on destroying the Earth and moving to another planet. As for the potential for us to mess up the Earth sufficiently to require us to leave the planet, perhaps we should work harder at looking after this planet rather than looking for another one to damage."
Against,"The risk of us being wiped out
by an asteroid like the
dinosaurs is very very small. In
any case unmanned missions (missiles, satellite mounted lasers
etc.) would probably be as
effective as any manned attempt
to divert an asteroid despite what
films like Armageddon and Deep
Impact might suggest."
Against,Significant private capital can be raised for space exploration. Even if NASA is unwilling to fund a particular project does not mean it cannot take place – the Beagle 2 project to search for life on Mars was organised by British scientist Professor Colin Pillinger and raised a significant amount of its ?50m cost from private sources and sponsorship. The Beagle 2 never responded from the surface of the Red Planet but the principle of scientific communities being able to raise sufficient capital for small unmanned missions has been proven.
Against,"Private markets are better
suited to invest in space
exploration What better way to
colonise space than to leave it to
the private market to develop the
space tourism market to include
space hotels and moon bases?
The success of the $10m X Prize
at attracting interest and private
investment in private space
programmes has shown that
there is no need for the state to
be involved in space travel on the
non---science side. Given suitable
international safety standards (as
were agreed on air travel in the
inter---war period) it would
transfer the investment and risk
away from the taxpayer as well as producing the sort of space travel
that would really inspire the
human race – the sort that tens of
thousands of people would
actually get a chance to take part
in."
Against,"Space funding would be better spent helping people on earth Dennis Kucinich, responding to president Bush's 2004 space initiatives, said: ""I also want to explore planet Earth and planet D.C.""[1]"
Against,"The costs of pushing the boundaries in space are too high. Even with a budget of $16.5bn for 2006, NASA expects it will take more than a decade to return to the moon and has no date for Mars. The cost of really pushing the boundaries of human exploration is too high even for the big---spending Bush administration, so surely we need to examine the scientific and technological returns of the space programme as it really is rather than how it appears in Star Trek"
Against,"Going into space to discover the effects of space on humans is circular logic. The argument that humans need to be in space in order to find out the effects of being in space should be treated with caution; it is essentially a circular argument as with no manned missions, there would be no need to find out the impact of space on humans."
Against,Few missions to space have produced notable scientific results. There are few experiments so important that they can justify the huge cost needed to allow them to be carried out by humans in zero gravity. NASA made a lot of noise about growing zero---gravity protein crystals as a potential cure for cancer when it was trying to justify building the ISS but has since dropped the claims as experiments have shown the claims were overstated.
Against,"The scientific benefits of manned space programmes are severely overstated; NASA spends over a third of its budget simply keeping the ISS manned and the Space Shuttle working. The vast majority of its spending on scientific research comes through ground based research, telescopes and unmanned missions. China has made no claims that there is a scientific benefit to its manned mission and nor has Russia in recent years."
Against,"There is sufficient room for exploration on earth; space is excessive. Rather than probing Mars for life, we should be looking to the 95% of the world’s oceans that have yet to be explored and where we are constantly finding new forms of life and new scientific discoveries. For example, bacteria have been found which survive not by using sunlight as an energy source, but volcanic vents on the ocean floor – a discovery which made scientists looking for life on Mars totally change their approach. And with individuals constantly in the news for attempts to traverse the globe in rowing boats, hot air balloons and tied to gliders, there are clearly enough ‘boundaries’ on this planet to keep even our keenest explorers happy."
Against,"Space exploration is a waste of resources. If we wish to tackle the problems of overpopulation, or of the depletion of resources, we must deal with them on the Earth instead of chasing an elusive dream. There are practical ways in which we can deal with the problems of our planet, and we must pursue them with all the resources and all the political will we have available"
Against,"These spin-off advantages could come from any ‘blue-sky’ project - they are a result of the huge amounts of money and manpower devoted to the space programme, giving people the resources they need to solve problems, rather than a result of the programme itself. For example, many of the leaps forward in miniaturisation were in fact the result of trying to build better nuclear missiles; this is not a good reason to continue building nuclear weapons. It would be far better to devote similar resources to projects with worthier goals – for example cancer research, or research into renewable energy sources. These too could have many spinoff benefits, but would tackle real problems."
Against,"Satellite technology has of course had a beneficial effect on our world. However, there is a huge difference between launching satellites into Earth orbit, and exploring space. Missions to other planets, and into interstellar space, do not contribute to life on our planet. Moreover, satellites are largely commercial - they are launched by private companies, and are maintained by the profits which they lead to. True space exploration could never be commercial, and requires huge government subsidies - the Voyager missions alone cost just under $1 billion. This money could be much better spent elsewhere."
Against,"High ideals are all well and good, but not when they come at the expense of the present. Our world is marred by war, famine, and poverty; billions of people are struggling simply to live from day to day. Our dreams of exploring space are a luxury they cannot afford. Instead of wasting our time and effort on macho prestige projects such as the space programme, we must set ourselves new targets. Once we have addressed the problems we face on Earth, we will have all the time we want to explore the universe; but not before then. The money spent on probes to distant planets would be better invested in the people of our own planet. A world free from disease, a world where no-one lives in hunger, would be a truly great achievement."
